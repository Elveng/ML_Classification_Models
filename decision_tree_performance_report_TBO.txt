In this code, pandas library is used for:
  - Loading and handling the training and testing datasets (pd.read_csv).
  - Organizing and transforming the data into a format suitable for decision tree and random forest algorithms.
  - Storing and manipulating the features and labels in a tabular format.

And numpy library is used for:
  - Numerical operations on arrays, such as mean calculations (np.mean).
  - Handling and transforming data in a numerical format, which is crucial for machine learning algorithms.
  - Efficiently working with potential splits and other numerical calculations in the decision tree and random forest algorithms.
